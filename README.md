This code quiz was created as a way to showcase my skills in using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This code quiz contains 15 multiple choice questions about coding. 

When the user interacts with the quiz, they will initially see an information page explaining the quiz rules and a start button. Once the start button is clicked, the user will be taken to the quiz, and a timer will start. Once the user has answered all the questions or the timer runs out, the quiz will end, and the user will be taken to a results page. The user will then have the option to add their initials and save their score. This score will then be saved to local storage and will be retrieveable. 

To accomplish this, I used variables, functions, if/else statements, for loops, and event listeners so the page is responsive to user clicks. 

By completing this project, I was able to consolidate my skills using Javascript and understand the functionality behind each rule, and visualise how their execution can change a webpage.

To ensure this webpage meets accessibility requirements, I have added alt tags to each image, commented on each CSS element, and ensured the CSS file follows the same structure as the HTML. 

Within this repository, you will find:
- Links to the live webpage of my quiz
- Screenshots of the webpage
- HTML, CSS, and Javascript coding associated with the page
- This README 
- An assets folder, containing images used in the webpage
